(Binary content of favicon.ico file should be placed here. Since I cannot handle binary files, I will provide a placeholder indicating that the favicon.ico file should be placed in the app/ directory.)

// This is a placeholder. Replace this with the actual favicon.ico file.
// Ensure the favicon.ico file is located in the app/ directory.
// Next.js 13+ with App Router looks for favicon.ico directly in the app/ folder.
